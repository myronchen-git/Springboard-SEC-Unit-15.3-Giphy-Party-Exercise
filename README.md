# Springboard-SEC-Unit-15.3-Giphy-Party-Exercise

A simple app to exercise my knowledge of AJAX.

A user can type in a search term, and the app will then call the Giphy API Random Endpoint and append the returned gif to this app's webpage.  Gifs will continually be appended after each search.  A user can remove all gifs by pressing a button.
